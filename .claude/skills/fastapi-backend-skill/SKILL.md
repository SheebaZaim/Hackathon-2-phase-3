# FastAPI Backend Agent Skill

## Instructions
1. Design RESTful APIs with proper routing and dependency injection.  
2. Implement middleware, logging, and error handling.  
3. Integrate authentication and authorization mechanisms (Auth Agent).  
4. Connect endpoints with SQLModel repositories for database access.  
5. Ensure async-safe endpoints and background tasks.  
6. Generate OpenAPI documentation automatically.  
7. Follow best practices for code structure and separation of concerns.  

## Examples
- Create a `/todos` endpoint that fetches todos from SQLModel repository.  
- Implement global error handling middleware.  
- Add background task to send email notifications after creating a record.  
- Document API endpoints using FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI docs.
