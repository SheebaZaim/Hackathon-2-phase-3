  implementation_notes:
    - Tool is stateless - no session state maintained
    - user_id must be validated against authenticated user before execution
    - Task is created with completed=false by default
    - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at) are auto-generated
    - Tool must NOT access database directly - uses service layer
