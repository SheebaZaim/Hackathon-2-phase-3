# Create Todo App Phase II Specification

## Original Prompt
Create the file `specs/sp.specify.md` defining WHAT the system is, HOW it behaves, and WHAT requirements it must satisfy for Phase II of the hackathon. The specification should include:
1. Project Overview - Describe Phase II Todo Full-Stack Web Application transforming from console app to web app with multi-user and persistent storage
2. System Architecture - Monorepo structure, separation of frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI), role of Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code
3. Technology Stack - Frontend, backend, and database details
4. Authentication Model - Better Auth role, JWT token issuance, JWT contents, stateless verification
5. JWT Authentication Flow - Step-by-step login, token issuance, attachment, verification process
6. API Specification - List all REST endpoints, describe behavior of each endpoint, explain authentication requirement for each
7. Data Models - Task entity fields, user-task relationship, ownership rules

## Response Summary
Created the comprehensive specification document for the Todo App Phase II project with all required sections. The spec defines the transformation from a console app to a multi-user web application with secure authentication, persistent storage, and detailed API specifications.

## Key Elements Created
