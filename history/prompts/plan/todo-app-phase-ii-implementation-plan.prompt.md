# Todo App Phase II Implementation Plan

## Original Prompt
Create the file `specs/sp.plan.md` defining HOW the Phase II system will be built step-by-step by Claude Code. The plan should include:
1. Planning Overview - Explain goal of the plan, emphasize spec-driven execution
2. Phase 1: Monorepo & Environment Setup - Folder structure, Spec-Kit configuration, environment variables
3. Phase 2: Database Layer - SQLModel schema definition, Neon PostgreSQL connection, persistent storage setup
4. Phase 3: Backend Authentication - JWT middleware creation, token extraction and verification, user identity extraction, error handling
5. Phase 4: Backend API Implementation - CRUD endpoints, ownership enforcement, completion toggle logic
6. Phase 5: Frontend Authentication - Better Auth setup, JWT plugin enablement, secure token handling
7. Phase 6: Frontend UI - Task list UI, task create/update UI, auth-protected routes, responsive design
8. Phase 7: Integration & Validation - End-to-end auth testing, multi-user isolation verification, API security validation
9. Phase 8: Documentation & Cleanup - README, environment setup

## Response Summary
Created the comprehensive implementation plan for the Todo App Phase II project with all required phases. The plan defines the step-by-step approach for building the full-stack web application with JWT-based authentication, following the constitutional requirements and feature specifications.

## Key Elements Created
- Planning Overview explaining the spec-driven execution approach
- Phase-by-phase breakdown from environment setup to documentation
- Technical Context with language/dependency specifications
- Constitution Check ensuring compliance with architectural constraints
- Project Structure with detailed directory layouts
- Research findings and decision rationales
- Data model definitions
- Quickstart guide for development setup
